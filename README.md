A new version of the Junicode font (previously hosted on Sourceforge) featuring full compliance with
the [Medieval Unicode Font Initiative](https://skaldic.abdn.ac.uk/m.php?p=mufi) specification (version 4.0) and including all medieval characters
added to Unicode since MUFI 4.0. The font:

- is made with the [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/) font editor;
- has the same character set in all faces;
- has five weights (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold)
- and three widths (Regular, SemiCondensed, Condensed);
- includes a variable font version;
- has improved outlines,
- an expanded collection of small caps (covering all case-paired characters),
- a more comprehensive set of anchors for mark positioning,
- and additional OpenType features—automatic runic transcription, access to fleurons, and more.

For a specimen of the roman face and a demonstration of the font’s many OpenType features, visit

All this is very much in progress. As of 7 October 2020, the roman face is complete (though metrics, anchors, and some
features still need work), and work on the italic is about 56% complete.
